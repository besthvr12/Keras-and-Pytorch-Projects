## Blood Cells Classification Using Keras
### Introduction
The average human adult has more than 5 liters (6 quarts) of blood in his or her body. Blood carries oxygen and nutrients to living cells and takes away their waste products. It also delivers immune cells to fight infections and contains platelets that can form a plug in a damaged blood vessel to prevent blood loss.

Through the circulatory system, blood adapts to the body's needs. When you are exercising, your heart pumps harder and faster to provide more blood and hence oxygen to your muscles. During an infection, the blood delivers more immune cells to the site of infection, where they accumulate to ward off harmful invaders.

### Types of Blood Cells:
 
#### 1.Neutrophils
Neutrophils are also known as polymorphonuclear cells because they contain a nucleus whose shape (morph) is irregular and contains many (poly) lobes. They also belong to a group of WBCs known as granulocytes because their cytoplasm is dotted with granules that contain enzymes that helps them digest pathogens.
#### 2.Lymphocytes
Lymphocytes are round cells that contain a single, large round nucleus. There are two main classes of cells, the B cells that mature in the bone marrow, and the T cells that mature in the thymus gland.
#### 3.Eosinophils
Eosinophils are a type of disease-fighting white blood cell. This condition most often indicates a parasitic infection, an allergic reaction or cancer. You can have high levels of eosinophils in your blood (blood eosinophilia) or in tissues at the site of an infection or inflammation (tissue eosinophilia).
#### 4.Monocyte
Monocytes are a type of leukocyte, or white blood cell. They are the largest type of leukocyte and can differentiate into macrophages and myeloid lineage dendritic cells. As a part of the vertebrate innate immune system monocytes also influence the process of adaptive immunity.
