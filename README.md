## Blood Cells Classification Using Pytorch
### Introduction
The average human adult has more than 5 liters (6 quarts) of blood in his or her body. Blood carries oxygen and nutrients to living cells and takes away their waste products. It also delivers immune cells to fight infections and contains platelets that can form a plug in a damaged blood vessel to prevent blood loss.

Through the circulatory system, blood adapts to the body's needs. When you are exercising, your heart pumps harder and faster to provide more blood and hence oxygen to your muscles. During an infection, the blood delivers more immune cells to the site of infection, where they accumulate to ward off harmful invaders.

### Types of Blood Cells:
 
#### 1.Neutrophils
Neutrophils are also known as polymorphonuclear cells because they contain a nucleus whose shape (morph) is irregular and contains many (poly) lobes. They also belong to a group of WBCs known as granulocytes because their cytoplasm is dotted with granules that contain enzymes that helps them digest pathogens.
